<!-- Used id to justify text in css-->
<p id="justify">After retiring as an Air Force Marketing Director for the United States Air Force Recruiting Service, I've worked as a Technical IT Recruiter 
and College Recruitment Manager at an IT College. </p> 
<p id="justify">During the mid 2000's to 2010, I hosted nearly 20 direct response websites that generated a monthly income and became very familiar with HTML.  I've been an entrepreneur since that time.</p>
<p id="justify">As a student at Thinkful, I'm pursuing a long desired career of becoming a web and software developer and loving it.  I enjoy solving problems, which gives me a sense of accomplishment.</p>

<p id="justify">If your looking to hire a new developer that believes in working hard and working as a team player, feel free to contact me.  I'm really looking forward to contributing to the synergy of a team.</p>
